Summer 2021

## Abstract
The past year has seen a massive growth in the value and volume of sales in digital art. NFT (Non-fungible token) marketplaces are booming and record sales are being recorded. <br>
Overall, many small artists are finding recognition and the digital art market is at the highest it has ever been. Amazon, the worldâ€™s biggest online retailer, has been keeping a close eye on the development of the digital art market and wants to step through the door. After brainstorming with the MMA consulting team, Amazon believes it can put forward a solution that can provide a robust infrastructure for art sales, providing both traditional and digital art works. <br>
The purpose of the AmazArt database is to provide the infrastructure required to support a user-directed and secure marketplace for pieces by both traditional and digital artists. This infrastructure allows both the management of sales and orders, supports an intuitive and user-tailored interface and gives opportunities for its users to interact via different events.
